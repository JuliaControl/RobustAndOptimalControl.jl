We provide two general means of modeling uncertainty, the traditional $M\Delta$ framework [^Skogestad][^Doyle91], and a Monte-Carlo approach using [MonteCarloMeasurements.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/MonteCarloMeasurements.jl)


## Parametric uncertainty using [MonteCarloMeasurements.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/MonteCarloMeasurements.jl)
The most straightforward way to model uncertainty is to use uncertain parameters, using tools such as [IntervalArithmetic](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/IntervalArithmetic.jl) (strict, worst case guarantees) or [MonteCarloMeasurements](https://github.com/baggepinnen/MonteCarloMeasurements.jl) (less strict worst-case analysis or probabilistic).
In the following, we show an example with MIMO systems with both parametric uncertainty and diagonal, complex uncertainty, adapted from 8.11.3 in Skogestad, "Multivariable Feedback Control: Analysis and Design". This example is also available as a julia script in [`uncertain.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaControl/RobustAndOptimalControl.jl/blob/master/examples/uncertain.jl).

### Example in section 3.7.1, Spinning satellite
```@example satellite
using RobustAndOptimalControl, ControlSystems, MonteCarloMeasurements, Plots, LinearAlgebra
default(size=(640,480))
unsafe_comparisons(true)

a = 10
P = ss([0 a; -a 0], I(2), [1 a; -a 1], 0)
K = ss(1.0I(2))

w = 2π .* exp10.(LinRange(-2, 2, 500))
S, PS, CS, T = RobustAndOptimalControl.gangoffour2(P, K)
sigmaplot(S, w, lab="S")
sigmaplot!(T, w, c=2, lab="T", ylims=(0.01, 45))
```

Both sensitivity functions are very large, expect a non-robust system!

Next, we add parametric uncertainty
```@example satellite
a = 10*(1 + 0.1δr(100)) # Create an uncertain parameter with nominal value 10 and 10% uncertainty
P = ss([0 a; -a 0], I(2), [1 a; -a 1], 0)

Sp, PSp, CSp, Tp = RobustAndOptimalControl.gangoffour2(P, K)
sigmaplot(Sp, w, lab="S")
sigmaplot!(Tp, w, c=2, lab="T", ylims=(0.01, 100))
```

Not only are sensitivity functions large, they vary a lot under the considered uncertainty. We can also plot a step response of one of the sensitivity functions to check how the system behaves
```@example satellite
plot(step(c2d(Tp, 0.01), 10))
```
This kind of plot is quite useful, it immediately tells you that this transfer function appears stable, and that there is uncertainty in the static gain etc.

Next, we add complex diagonal multiplicative input uncertainty. With input uncertainty of magnitude
$ϵ < \dfrac{1}{σ̄(T)}$ we are guaranteed robust stability (even for “full-block complex perturbations")

```@example satellite
a = 10
P = ss([0 a; -a 0], I(2), [1 a; -a 1], 0)

W0 = makeweight(0.2, (20,1), 2)
W = I(2) + W0 * diagm([δc(100), δc(100)]) # Create a diagonal complex uncertainty weighted in frequency by W0, use 100 samples
Ps = P*W
Ss, PSs, CSs, Ts = RobustAndOptimalControl.gangoffour2(Ps, K)
sigmaplot(Ss, w, lab="S")
sigmaplot!(Ts, w, c=2, lab="T", ylims=(0.01, 100))
```

Under this uncertainty, the sensitivity could potentially be sky high., note how some of the 100 realizations peak much higher than the others. This is an indication that the system might be unstable.

With complex entries in the system model, we can't really plot the step response, but we can plot, e.g., the absolute value
```@example satellite
res = step(c2d(Ts, 0.01), 10)
plot(res.t, [abs.(res.y)[1,:,1] abs.(res.y)[2,:,2]]) # plot only the diagonal response
```
Looks unstable to me. The analysis using $M\Delta$ methodology below will also reach this conclusion.


### Example in section 3.7.2, Distillation Process
```@example distill
using RobustAndOptimalControl, ControlSystems, MonteCarloMeasurements, Plots, LinearAlgebra
default(size=(640,480))
unsafe_comparisons(true)

M = [87.8 -86.4; 108.2 -109.6]
G = ss(tf(1, [75, 1])) * M
RGA = relative_gain_array(G, 0)
sum(abs, RGA) # A good estimate of the true condition number, which is 141.7
```
large elements in the RGA indicate a process that is difficult to control

We consider the following inverse-based controller, which may also be looked upon as a steady-state decoupler with a PI controller
```@example distill
k1 = 0.7
Kinv = ss(tf(k1*[75, 1], [1, 0])) * inv(M) 

# reference filter
F = tf(1, [5, 1])

w = 2π .* exp10.(LinRange(-2, 2, 500))
sigmaplot(input_sensitivity(G, Kinv), w)
sigmaplot!(output_sensitivity(G, Kinv), w, c=2)
```

Sensitivity looks nice, how about step response
```@example distill
plot(step(feedback(G*Kinv)*F, 20))
```

Looks excellent..

We consider again the input gain uncertainty as in the previous example, and we manually select the perturbations to be $ϵ_1 = 0.2$ and $ϵ_2 = 0.2$. We then have
```@example distill
G′ = G * diagm([1 + 0.2, 1 - 0.2])
plot!(step(feedback(G′*Kinv)*F, 20), l=:dash)
```

Looks very poor! The system was not robust to simultaneous input uncertainty!

We can also do this with a real, diagonal input uncertainty that grows with frequency
```@example distill
W0 = Weights.makeweight(0.2, 1, 2.0) # uncertainty goes from 20% at low frequencies to 200% at high frequencies
W = I(2) + W0 * diagm([δr(100), δr(100)])
Gs = G*W

plot(step(feedback(G*Kinv)*F, 20))
plot!(step(feedback(G′*Kinv)*F, 20), l=:dash)
res = step(c2d(feedback(Gs*Kinv)*F, 0.01), 20)
mcplot!(res.t, abs.(res.y[:, :, 1]'), alpha=0.3)
mcplot!(res.t, abs.(res.y[:, :, 2]'), alpha=0.3)
```

The system is very sensitive to real input uncertainty!

With a complex, diagonal uncertainty, modeling both gain and phase variations, it looks slightly worse, but not much worse than with real uncertainty.
```@example distill
W = I(2) + W0 * diagm([δc(100), δc(100)]) # note δc instead of δr above
Gs = G*W
res = step(c2d(feedback(Gs*Kinv)*F, 0.01), 20)
mcplot!(res.t, abs.(res.y[:, :, 1]'), alpha=0.3)
mcplot!(res.t, abs.(res.y[:, :, 2]'), alpha=0.3)
```

How about the sensitivity functions?
```@example distill
Si = input_sensitivity(Gs, Kinv)
sigmaplot(Si, w, c=1, lab="Si")
So = output_sensitivity(Gs, Kinv)
sigmaplot!(So, w, c=2, lab="So")
```

The sensitivity at the plant output is enormous. A low sensitivity with the nominal system does not guarantee robustness!


## Using the $M\Delta$ framework
The examples above never bothered with things like structured singular value, $\mu$ or linear-fractional transforms. We do, however, provide some elementary support for this modeling framework.



In robust control, we often find ourselves having to consider the feedback interconnections below.

The first block diagram denotes an open-loop system $P$ with an uncertainty mapping $w_\Delta = \Delta  z_\Delta$, a *performance mapping* from $w$ to $z$ and a input-output mapping between $u$ and $y$. Such a system $P$ can be partitioned as
```math
P = \begin{bmatrix}
P_{11} & P_{12} & P_{13}\\
P_{21} & P_{22} & P_{23}\\
P_{31} & P_{32} & P_{33}\\
\end{bmatrix}
```
where each $P(s)_{ij}$ is a transfer matrix. The type [`UncertainSS`](@ref) with constructor [`uss`](@ref) represents the block
```math
P = \begin{bmatrix}
P_{11} & P_{12}\\
P_{21} & P_{22}\\
\end{bmatrix}
```
while an [`ExtendedStateSpace`](@ref) object represents the block
```math
P = \begin{bmatrix}
P_{22} & P_{23}\\
P_{32} & P_{33}\\
\end{bmatrix}
```
there is thus no type that represents the full system $P$ above. However, we provide the function [`partition`](@ref) which allows you to convert from a regular statespace system to an extended statespace object, and it is thus possible to represent $P$ by placing the whole block 
```math
P = \begin{bmatrix}
P_{22} & P_{23}\\
P_{32} & P_{33}\\
\end{bmatrix}
```
into $P_{22}$ for the purposes of uncertainty analysis (use `ss` to convert it to a standard statespace object), and later use [`partition`](@ref) to recover the internal block structure. 

Given an [`UncertainSS`](@ref) $P$, we can close the loop around $\Delta$ by calling `lft(P, Δ, :u)`, and given an [`ExtendedStateSpace`](@ref), we can close the loop around `K` by calling `starprod(P, K)` or `lft(P, K)` (using positive feedback). This works even if `P` is a regular statespace object, in which case the convention is that the inputs and outputs are ordered as in the block diagrams above. The number of signals that will be connected by [`lft`](@ref) is determined by the input-output arity of $K$ and $\Delta$ respectively.

We have the following methods for `lft` (in addition to the standard ones in ControlSystems.jl)
- `lft(G::UncertainSS, K::LTISystem)` forms the lower LFT closing the loop around $K$.
- `lft(G::UncertainSS, Δ::AbstractArray=G.Δ)` forms the upper LFT closing the loop around $\Delta$.
- `lft(G::ExtendedStateSpace, K)` forms the lower LFT closing the loop around $K$.

### Robust stability and performance
To check robust stability of the system in the last block diagram (with or without $z$ and $w$), we can use the functions [`structured_singular_value`](@ref), [`robstab`](@ref) and [`diskmargin`](@ref).

Currently, [`structured_singular_value`](@ref) is rather limited and supports diagonal complex blocks only. If $\Delta$ is a single full complex block, `opnorm(P.M) < 1` is the condition for stability.

Robust performance can be verified by introducing an additional fictitious "performance perturbation" $\Delta_p$ which is a full complex block, around which we close the loop from $z$ to $w$ and check the [`structured_singular_value`](@ref) with the augmented perturbation block
```math
\Delta_a = \begin{bmatrix}
\Delta & 0\\
0      & \Delta_p\\
\end{bmatrix}
```



### Examples
We repeat the first example here, but using $M\Delta$ formalism rather than direct Monte-Carlo modeling.



```@example satellite
a = 10
P = ss([0 a; -a 0], I(2), [1 a; -a 1], 0)
W0 = Weights.makeweight(0.2, (1,1), 2)
W = ss(1.0I(2)) + (ss(W0)*I(2)) * uss([δc(), δc()]) # Create a diagonal complex uncertainty weighted in frequency by W0
# note how considerably more verbose the line above is compared to when sampled uncertainties were used, this is an indication of the experimental state of the MΔ tools
Ps = P*W
```
`Ps` is now represented as a upper linear fractional transform (upper LFT).

We can draw samples from this uncertainty representation (sampling of $\Delta$ and closing the loop `starprod(Δ, Ps)`) like so
```@example satellite
Psamples = rand(Ps, 100)
sigmaplot(Psamples, w)
```

We can extract the nominal model using

```@example satellite
system_mapping(Ps)
```
And obtain $M$ and $\Delta$ when the loop is closed with $K$ has
```@example satellite
lft(Ps, K).M
```
```@example satellite
Ps.Δ # Ps.delta also works
```
We can evaluate the frequency response of $M$ and calculate the structured singular value $\mu$

```@example satellite
M = freqresp(lft(Ps, -K).M, w) # -K to get negative feedback
M = permutedims(M, (2,3,1))
μ = structured_singular_value(M)
plot(w, μ, xscale=:log10)
```

$\mu$ is very high, whenever $\mu > 1$, the system is not stable with respect to the modeled uncertainty.
The tolerated uncertainty is only about $\dfrac{1}{||\mu||_\infty}$
```@example satellite
1/norm(μ, Inf)
```
of the modeled uncertainty. Another way of calculating this value is
```@example satellite
robstab(lft(Ps, -K))
```
