    makeweight(low, [mid,] high)

Create a weighting function that goes from gain `low` at zero frequency, through gain `mid` to gain `high` at ∞

# Arguments:
- `low`: A number specifying the DC gain 
- `mid`: A number specifying the frequency at which the gain is 1, or a tuple `(freq, gain)`. If `mid` is not specified, the geometric mean of `high` and `low` is used.
- `high`: A number specifying the gain at ∞

Return a multiplicative weight to represent the uncertainty coming from neglecting the dynamics `k*exp(-s*L)`

This weight is slightly optimistic, an expression for a more exact weight appears in eq (7.27), "Multivariable Feedback Control: Analysis and Design"

    centers, radii = fit_complex_perturbations(P, w; relative=true, nominal=:mean)

For each frequency in `w`, fit a circle in the complex plane that contains all models in the model set `P`, represented as an `LTISystem` with `Particles` coefficients. Note, the resulting radii can be quite unstable if the number of particles is small, in particular if the particles are normally distributed instead of uniformly.

If `realtive = true`, circles encompassing `|(P - Pn)/Pn|` will be returned (multiplicative/relative uncertainty).
If `realtive = false`, circles encompassing `|P - Pn|` will be returned (additive uncertainty).

If `nominal = :mean`, the mean of `P` will be used as nominal model. If `nominal = :first`, the first particle will be used. See `MonteCarloMeasurements.with_nominal` to set the nominal value in the first particle. 

See also [`nyquistcircles`](@ref) to plot circles (only if relative=false).
